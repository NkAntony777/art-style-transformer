# Art Style Transformer

## Overview
Art Style Transformer is a web-based application that performs neural style transfer, blending the content of an image with the artistic style of another. This project uses PyTorch's pre-trained VGG19 model and implements neural networks to achieve the transformation. It also features a simple interface built using Streamlit, where users can upload their own content and style images.

### Features
- Convert images into artistic styles like **Picasso** or **Van Gogh**.
- Web-based interface for image uploads and visualizations.
- Real-time style transfer with configurable weights and parameters.
